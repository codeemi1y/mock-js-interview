# Code Emily Mock Interview

Begin by opening the file called "mock-interview.js" inside of the src file.

Inside of this file,  you'll find 4 JavaScript exercises. Complete these. 

Run the following to check your work:

```npm i && npm run test```


The last question in the mock-interview file is the React portion of the coding challenge. Follow the instructions in the mock-interview.js file to complete this.

## Running the React project:

This is a project set up using Vite.

You can run the project by running the following in your terminal:

```npm i && npm run dev```

## Extra tips:
Treat this exercise the same way you would a live coding exercise: set a timer for an hour, talk through the questions, use the internet for syntax related questions, etc. 

If you get stuck, the Code Emily video walks through the solutions to each of the problems. Feel free to ask questions there as well!
